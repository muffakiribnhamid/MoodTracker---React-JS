<h2>🖥️ How It Works</h2>
<h3>User Registration and Login</h3>
<p>Users create accounts or log in using Firebase Authentication.</p>

<h3>Mood Updates</h3>
<p>After logging in, users can set and update their current mood, which is visible to others.</p>

<h3>Wave Emojis (👋)</h3>
<p>Browse through the user list, view profiles, and send waves to connect with others. Each wave sends a real-time notification.</p>

<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
<p>
  Mobile-friendly layout ensures a smooth user experience. On smaller screens, user details are well-aligned, and emojis are 
  displayed below profile details for better visibility.
